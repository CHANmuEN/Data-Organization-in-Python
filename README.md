Data Organization 4: Data Sorting, Removing Duplicates, and Filtering
This encompasses operations to sort datasets based on specific criteria, remove duplicate entries, and filter datasets to include only the rows or entries that meet certain conditions.

Data Organization 5: Data Merging and Referencing
This refers to combining data from multiple datasets based on common keys or columns, as well as referencing data between different datasets to create relationships or perform lookups.
